"""
The shutil.copy() function will only copy a single fileâ€”not an entire directory. 
To copy all the files and subdirectories within static, you'll need to traverse 
through its contents, identifying whether each item is a file or subdirectory. 
This is where recursion becomes important.

How will you distinguish between files and subdirectories in static? 
What function might help you differentiate and handle those cases?
